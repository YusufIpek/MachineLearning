#Tasks for RL assignment

1- read and study RL lectures.

2- install gym open source library and set the environment 

'pip install gym'

if you got error with running on windows, please check this link [https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/868]

3- try to solve the mountain car task using linear value function (v fun)

	- using TD & V(s,a)
	- action-value function Q(s,a)
	- polynomial feature vector
	- try multiple runs 

4- create reports and blot graphs for observations and results


5- prepare report
