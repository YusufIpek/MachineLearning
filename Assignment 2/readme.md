adding Read.me file that will contain all steps to do ( assignment requirements ):

1. Run the original example.


2. By altering the network structure, parameters, initialization, training procedure, etc., try to achieve better results
than the original example.

- enhance the network structure
- enhance the parameters 
- trying different examples and options 

study the following parts:

(1) the number of conv-relu layer pairs

(2) dropout layers  ( kamal )

(3) pooling parameters, and

(4) minibatch size.

3. Report on your findings.

- writing down all tuning and enhancement done in the code with explaination 
- prepare the report as early as possible
- ploting our model

'from keras.utils import plot_model'
'plot_model(model, to_file='model.png')'

for submission:
• Give the names of all members of the group. If the members’ contributions differ substantially, explain their
respective contributions.

• Discuss any algorithmic choices you made. Explain any deviations from the methods discussed in class.

• Give illustrations, numbers and results as described above.

• Discuss your results and any interesting insights and observations.

Tasks:
- check the data augmentation
- write down the expermints and the notes, and the reasons.
- figures and archticture plots
